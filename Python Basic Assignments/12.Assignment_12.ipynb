       "'consistent with theories of spatial competition (e.g., d’Aspremont et al. 1979), weﬁnd that Honda\\nand Toyota choose diﬀerent geographic areas to target that minimize overlap and add an extra\\nlevel element of diﬀerentiation between the two manufacturers. We are also able to measure the\\nimpact of temporary price reductions, such as a promotional campaign, on geographic dispersion\\nof demand. On average, weﬁnd that a discount of 10% on prices leads to an expansion of 5 miles\\nin the market area radius.\\nWe also evaluate the impact of changes in product assortment and retailer locations. In order\\nto obtain new equilibrium prices for all alternatives when market conditions change, we model the\\nsupply side and obtain estimates of manufacturer costs and margins. On average, manufacturer\\nvariable costs reach about 50% of the manufacturer price to retailers. Fullsize SUVs are more\\nexpensive to produce than compact and mini SUVs and some of the car attributes that explain\\ncost are engine size - $3,300 per unit of displacement - and transmission type - manual drive costs\\nabout $1,500 less than automatic. Manufacturer margins run from $9,000 to $16,000, while retailer\\nmargins are a tenth of those values, with an average of $1,500.\\nFinally, we quantify changes in proﬁt and market areas from two managerial decisions: the\\nrelocation of a dealership and the removal of a car model from the market. We exemplify the\\nﬁrst situation by moving a Toyota dealership from the suburbs to a location close to downtown.\\nWeﬁnd that the proﬁts not includingﬁxed costs are improved by selecting the new location due\\nto higher population density, even though thereare other Toyota dealers serving a neighboring\\narea. We estimate that the lower bound forﬁxed costs preventing Toyota from relocating the\\ndealer to be about $500,000 per year. A second counterfactual is exempliﬁed by removing the\\nFord Excursion model from the market, which actually happened in late 2005. Although weﬁnd\\nthat Ford would lose signiﬁcant proﬁts from consumer switching to other brands, the majority\\nof Excursion consumers would still buy a SUV, thus not decreasing signiﬁcantly the size of the\\ncategory.\\nThe paper continues by presenting the literature background for our paper. The description of\\nthe model is included in section 3 and Section 4 provides details about the several data sets used\\nin the paper. The estimation algorithm is presented in section 5 and the results are analyzed in\\nsection 6. Section 7 describes managerial applications and section 8 concludes.\\n5'"

      " 1Introduction\n",
      "The automobile industry has been the focus of numerous studies in recent years, both in economics\n",
      "and in marketing. This literature has covered a variety of themes, such as the analysis of demand\n",
      "and supply in the auto industry (Berry et al. 1995, Sudhir 2001, Berry et al. 2004), the inﬂuence\n",
      "of Internet on prices (e.g., Zettelmeyer et al. 2007; Scott Morton et al. 2001), and the impact of\n",
      "a new car form on consumer demand, for example, mini-vans (Petrin 2002) and SUVs (Luan et\n",
      "al. 2007). These studies provide considerable insights into how car manufacturers compete and\n",
      "on how consumers react to product characteristicsand marketing activities. However, central to\n",
      "this research, they tend to disregard the role played by the location of consumers and retailers. In\n",
      "particular, little is known about how dealer location and the geographic distribution of consumers\n",
      "interrelate to shape demand and competition patterns. Indeed, demand variation across geography\n",
      "and how manufacturer and dealer managers can inﬂuence its patterns has so far been unstudied in\n",
      "the literature, and our paper aims toﬁll this gap.\n",
      "Store location plays an important role in purchase decisions. Industry research has shown that a\n",
      "large percentage of variance in consumer store choice is explained by location (Progressive Grocer,\n",
      "1995) and managers spend considerable time and eﬀort to increase store attractiveness and traﬃc\n",
      "(Bell et al. 1998). Thus, we believe that this study is of importance to car manufacturers since\n",
      "a good understanding of the competitive environment and its characterization across geography\n",
      "is lacking in the literature, despite that it has been shown in other realms to serve as input for\n",
      "managerial decisions on pricing (e.g., Ellicksonand Misra 2008), store customization (e.g., Hoch et\n",
      "al. 1995), and future store locations (e.g., Duan and Mela 2008).\n",
      "Our objective is to evaluate and analyze geographic demand of cars at the dealer level, which\n",
      "is done in three ways. First, we determine how consumer demand depends on car characteristics,\n",
      "dealer characteristics, and geographic distance between buyers and sellers. Unique to our paper is\n",
      "that each alternative is deﬁned as a combination of a car, with its product attributes, and a dealer,\n",
      "at a given location. Its utility is therefore informative about the trade-oﬀbetween preferences for\n",
      "dealer location and car characteristics, including price. This approach allows us to describe market\n",
      "areas for each car model, dealership and manufacturer, i.e., the geographic areas where demand for\n",
      "an alternative is highest. Second, using estimates from the demand model, we measure substitution\n",
      "patterns between car dealerships and identify the set of main substitutes for each car, as judged\n",
      "by the intensity of cross-price elasticities. Third, our structural approach provides guidance on\n",
      "important manufacturer decisions - a temporary reduction in car prices, the relocation of a dealer\n",
      "3\n",
      "and the removal of a car model from the market. For each decision, we estimate new manufacturer\n",
      "proﬁts and the resulting pattern of geographic demand.\n",
      "To make these inferences, we estimate a random coeﬃcients nested logit model using a unique\n",
      "individual-level dataset with transaction information about dealer and manufacturer prices, car\n",
      "characteristics, and zip code location of sellers and buyers. We augment this transactional data\n",
      "using Census information on consumer demographics, and estimate the demand parameters using\n",
      "simulated maximum likelihood, while taking intoaccount consumer heterogeneity and endogeneity\n",
      "between prices and unobserved car attributes. Our method is easy to implement and uses data\n",
      "that are typically available to car manufacturers.\n",
      "We empirically demonstrate our approach using the sport utility vehicles category in the San\n",
      "Diego area. Regarding demand, our results show that consumers treat alternatives of the same car\n",
      "type - mini, compact, and fullsize - as close substitutes and even more so if they share the same\n",
      "brand. We argue that the main reason for this is the fact that SUVs within type share very similar\n",
      "features. Thus, our results suggest that a consumer who decides to buy a SUV is likely to search\n",
      "among available alternatives within a car type and much less so across diﬀerent car types.\n",
      "When deciding where to buy a car, consumers havea strong negative sensitivity to distance to\n",
      "car dealerships. The majority of demand of a car dealership originates from consumers located in\n",
      "close proximity and weﬁnd that the probability of consumers choosing a dealer declines sharply\n",
      "as distance increases. While substitution is strongest among alternatives of the same SUV type, it\n",
      "is signiﬁcantly higher if distance between dealers is small. In other words, the negative sensitivity\n",
      "to distance causes dealer and car substitution to be limited to short distances. As a result, each\n",
      "dealer has its own local demand ‘backyard’, shared with a small set of nearby alternatives of the\n",
      "same type and brand. As an output of our model, examples of geographic variation of demand\n",
      "across geography for cars, dealers, and manufacturers are provided.\n",
      "Our analysis shows that the shape of market areas is strongly determined by the location of\n",
      "competitors. For instance, it is not uncommon toﬁnd that the highest demand is not at the\n",
      "location of the dealer, but instead, at locations that are furthest from direct substitutes. Although\n",
      "this conclusion is to be expect, the ability to quantify it in a complex scenario of a multitude of\n",
      "dealers and alternatives in the market is nonetheless of extreme use for managers deciding on price\n",
      "and promotional activities.\n",
      "Additionally, we compute market areas at the manufacturer level by consolidating the market\n",
      "areas of its dealers and we report some interesting patterns in location decisions. For instance,\n",
      "4\n",
      "consistent with theories of spatial competition (e.g., d’Aspremont et al. 1979), weﬁnd that Honda\n",
      "and Toyota choose diﬀerent geographic areas to target that minimize overlap and add an extra\n",
      "level element of diﬀerentiation between the two manufacturers. We are also able to measure the\n",
      "impact of temporary price reductions, such as a promotional campaign, on geographic dispersion\n",
      "of demand. On average, weﬁnd that a discount of 10% on prices leads to an expansion of 5 miles\n",
      "in the market area radius.\n",
      "We also evaluate the impact of changes in product assortment and retailer locations. In order\n",
      "to obtain new equilibrium prices for all alternatives when market conditions change, we model the\n",
      "supply side and obtain estimates of manufacturer costs and margins. On average, manufacturer\n",

      "expensive to produce than compact and mini SUVs and some of the car attributes that explain\n",

      "about $1,500 less than automatic. Manufacturer margins run from $9,000 to $16,000, while retailer\n",
      "margins are a tenth of those values, with an average of $1,500.\n",
      "Finally, we quantify changes in proﬁt and market areas from two managerial decisions: the\n",

      " 2Background\n",
      "Our work is related to previous papers on the car industry, spatial competition, and search and\n",
      "travel cost. Berry et al. (1995 and 2004) study the automotive industry in two complementary\n",
      "papers. The authors start by developing a model that analyzes demand and supply of diﬀerentiated\n",
      "cars using aggregate-level data (1995) and then expand their methodology to combine micro and\n",
      "macro data (2004). Among other results, they are able to produce demand elasticities of price\n",
      "and other observed attributes andﬁnd considerable variability across types of cars and models.\n",
      "Sudhir (2001) provides additional insight on manufacturer competitive behavior, showing that it\n",
      "may diﬀer according to the car type: aggressive competitive behavior for smaller and cheaper\n",
      "car segments, cooperative behavior in the mid-size segment and Bertrand behavior in the full-size\n",
      "segment. Regarding the introduction of new products in the car industry, Petrin (2002) analyzes\n",
      "the impact of the introduction of the mini-van on consumer welfare using census data to create\n",
      "identiﬁcation moments to be used in his estimation, while Luan et al. (2007) evaluate the evolution\n",
      "of consumer preferences and market structure during the introduction and growth of sales of SUVs.\n",
      "Respectively, these papers show that consumer welfare increases when the minivan was introduced\n",
      "and that the market structure signiﬁcantly changed with the introduction of the sport utility\n",
      "vehicles. This literature on the car industry provides valuable insights on the interaction between\n",
      "car manufacturers and between car manufacturers and consumers, but assumes that consumers\n",
      "trade oﬀall alternatives based solely on car attributes, irrespective of whether such options are\n",
      "conveniently located close to where a consumer lives.\n",
      "The location of customers is central in the literature on spatial competition. The increasing\n",
      "interest in modeling spatial competition has led to recent examples covering a number of diﬀerent\n",
      "categories. For instance, competition between movie theaters and the impact of new movie theaters\n",
      "on consumer welfare is studied by Davis (2001). In similar fashion to our paper, Davis uses census\n",
      "data to identify the location and size of the potential market and quantiﬁes cross-revenue eﬀects\n",
      "between theaters. When multiple product or service quality levels exist, Mazzeo (2002) shows that\n",
      "the decision on quality levels can be made endogenous, based on the presence of competing locations\n",
      "in the hotel industry. Thomadsen (2007) presents anexample of spatial competition among retailers\n",
      "in the fast food industry and evaluates ownership structure and the impact of market geography\n",
      "on competition patterns. He uses consumer andﬁrms’ﬁrst order conditions from static Bertrand\n",
      "competition to estimate parameters in the absence of demand data. These papers use market-level\n",
      "data and lack accurate individual detail on the distance traveled to retailers. In contrast, our\n",
      "6\n",
      "estimates of spatial competition are based on actual location and distance traveled by consumers\n",
      "to purchase a product. Moreover, our research signiﬁcantly extends these papers by studying the\n",
      "simultaneous impact of distance, brand and product type on demand and retailer competition.\n",
      "There is a large tradition in information economics (e.g., Stigler 1961) on the eﬀect of costly\n",
      "search and travel on demand and competition. In recent studies of demand for consumer durable\n",
      "goods (e.g., Goeree 2008, Kim et al., 2008), or non-durable goods (e.g., Bruno and Vilcassim 2008),\n",
      "evidence is provided that the consumer takes into account travel and search costs, which reduces\n",
      "the choice probabilities of some alternatives beingbought and impacts inferences about competition\n",
      "and substitution. As an example of the recent interest in such issues in the car industry, Bucklin et\n",
      "al. (2008) model the impact of the number of dealers and its relative location on choice, showing\n",
      "that accessibility and concentration of dealers have a positive impact on car choice. We extend these\n",
      "papers by introducing the aspect of inconvenience due to travel between location of residence and\n",
      "point of sales in the demand for automobiles. This allows us to focus on the substitution patterns\n",
      "among options that are a combination of dealer-locations and car features. Such substitution\n",
      "patterns reveal geographical patterns of demand for each car dealership and can be used by the\n",
      "dealerships as an impetus to decisions about local marketing action, and by the manufacturer as\n",

      "The location of the two Hyundai dealers is displayed - the two dark circles - as well as the\n",
      "original and new isolines of average choice probabilities of 3% and 1% for Hyundai. The original\n",
      "lines show that locations where average choice probabilities were 3% and 1% before the discount.\n",
      "As in previous market areas, choice probabilities decline with distance. The drop in prices has\n",
      "the eﬀect of moving those lines outward, thus increasing choice probability for alternatives sold at\n",
      "the Hyundai dealers across the San Diego area. On average, equivalent choice probability lines are\n",

      "7.2 Relocation of a dealership\n",
      "Our model treats the location decisions of dealerships as exogenous to the current consumer and\n",

      "relocation of a Toyota dealership.\n",
      "The steps to obtain the proﬁt in a potential new location are as follows. We start by choosing a\n",

      "replace the actual distances to this dealer with the newly computed distances and obtain estimates\n",
      "for market share using our demand model. We thenobtain new equilibrium prices using the supply\n",

      "density in its surroundings, but also closer to the other two Toyota dealers. By relocating the dealer\n",
      "to this location, we quantify the trade-oﬀin proﬁts between concentrating dealers at areas of high\n",
      "demand and diﬀerentiation created by geographic distance between dealers.\n",
      "In terms of market areas, there is an obvious shift of demand creation to areas surrounding\n",

      "Diego will now have much less coverage. The manufacturer proﬁts not accounting forﬁxed costs\n",
      "of this new location would be $12.1MM compared to $11.6MM for the old location, a diﬀerence of\n",
      "about $500K a year, if demand would remain at these levels. The main diﬀerence comes from the\n",
      "fact that, although the three dealers are now moreconcentrated - leading to new equilibrium prices\n",
      "for Toyota to be lower by about $200 per car - they target the most populated area, which leads\n",

      "The data shows that the Ford Excursion accounted for about 4% of SUV Ford sales, and 1%\n",
